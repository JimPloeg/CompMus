Jim van der Ploeg - My Corpus

My Corpus will be modern electronic music, since it's the type of music I'm most familiar with. It's of course a relatively new type of music with much still unexplored and a lot has developed over even the past 20 years. What I think will be interesting to compare here is geographical differences: Western and Eastern cultures are of course very different of each other and this reflects in their music, but even between just Europe and America there should be plenty of differences that can be explored. Electronic music is a very wide genre with many different subgenres of which the popularity will be wildly different depending on both the region and the time - subgenres can fall out of favor just as quickly as they rise in popularity. Luckily, since most of the music I compare will be of very young age, most of it should be sufficiently cataloged on spotify. One note though is that the genre of modern electronic music is so vague that it's still hard to determine exactly which part of it will be used for this research. There is also some tracks that some might not exactly consider as electronic music, many tracks (especially ones I listen to) sortof fall on the edge between whether they're one genre or the other, which could be interesting to consider.


Week 7: Added Comparison graph

This comparison graph compares different information on a DJ set from two different DJs, Martin Garrix and Shingo Nakamura. Martin Garrix is a Dutch DJ performing a set of the house music genre whereas Shingo Nakamura is a japanese DJ performing a set of the progressive house genre.
Key differences that can be noted here are:
- the instrumentalness; Shingo Nakamura has a significantly higher instrumentalness in his DJ Set.
- The Energy level: Shingo Nakamura has a significantly higher energy level on average
